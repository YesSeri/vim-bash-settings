# Traceable Server States with Git and Nix

DBC Digital operates a fleet of servers specified, built, and deployed
using Nix expressions stored in a Git repository.
To ensure consistency, they require monitoring of build provenance and the current system state, so each server matches its intended configuration with only expected differences. 
Currently, DBC Digital records mappings from Nix store paths to Git commits in a CSV file, and uses a PHP script to query servers and display their nix store path and git revision mapping. While this provides some traceability, the approach is limited in performance, usability, and integration.
The current PHP-based approach is slow, offers limited interactivity, requires SSH access to all servers (a security risk), and integrates poorly with existing systems.
This project will build a secure, integrated system for monitoring and maintaining mappings between Nix store paths and Git revisions, including historical changes, across a fleet of servers.
At a minimum, the system should match the PHP script's functionality, while offering improved security and performance. Stretch goals include making the tool easy to deploy in a plug-and-play manner, ensuring it is user-friendly and well-documented as an open-source project, and further enhancing usability.
